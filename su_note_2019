1, Then type the following commands at a shell prompt:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
This forces the Linux kernel to crash, and the address-YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS/vmcore file 
is copied to the location you have selected in the configuration (that is, to /var/crash/ by default).

2, In the event that makedumpfile fails, then it is necessary to increase the log level to 
understand what is going wrong. This is different from setting the dump level and is achieved by 
editing /etc/kdump.conf and increasing the message_level option to makedumpfile on the core_collector line entry.
> By default makedumpfile is set to level 7, which includes the progress indicator, common message, and error message output. 
Set this level to 31 to get further debugging information.
> Ensure that your core_collector config line looks similar to this when set:
> core_collector makedumpfile -l --message-level 1 -d 31

3, SRIOV, VF, unmatched MAC address packet, tune "spoofchk" off, to pass it to VF.
ip link set eth0 vf 2 spoofchk off

4, batch: rename
ls | xargs -I X sh -c 'a=$(echo X |sed -n "s/.*_//p"); mv X $a'

5, get file permision with hex format
stat -c '%a' filename
